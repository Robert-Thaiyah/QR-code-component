## My process
I took my time to practise using divs and learn how to arrange them properly in a sequence that can be easily readable and css added to the relevant parts.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

Div Heirachy matters alot as a single error in div creation can cause havock in the entire HTML and CSS structure.

### Continued development

Daily perfection is the key to let the content stick and improve on my practise on HTML and CSS.
